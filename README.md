How to use Intel RealSense cameras as a YARP device
---------------------------------------------------

First of all, please install the `yarp-device-realsense2` following one (and just one) method listed below, and the move to the `Usage` section.

## Install with conda or pixi (easy)

You can easily the library with [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) in a new conda environment with
```
conda create -n newenvname -c conda-forge yarp-device-realsense2
```

`conda` will automatically install all the supported dependencies.

To add yarp-device-realsense2 to a [`pixi`](https://pixi.sh/latest/) project, just run:

```
pixi add yarp-device-realsense2
```

## Installation from source (advanced)

If you want to use a package manager (for example `apt` on Ubuntu) that does not provide `yarp-device-realsense2` packages, you can do that
as `yarp-device-realsense2` is a fairly standard CMake project. To do that, first of all install either via a package
manager or manually the following depencies:

### Dependencies
Before proceeding further, please install the following dependencies:

- [librealsense](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense)

### YARP compilation from source

If you are using `yarp` binary package from conda-forge or you compiled `yarp` via the `robotology-superbuild`, go to the next section.

**Only** if instead you manually compiled YARP, please make sure that the following CMake flags are enabled in the YARP CMake build:
```
ENABLE_yarpmod_rgbdSensor_nws_yarp
ENABLE_yarpmod_RGBDSensorClient
ENABLE_yarpcar_mjpeg
ENABLE_yarppm_depthimage_to_rgb
```

### Build and install yarp-device-realsense2

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation_path> ..
make
make install
```

In order to make the device detectable, add `<installation_path>/share/yarp` to the `YARP_DATA_DIRS` environment variable of the system.

Alternatively, if `YARP` has been installed using the [robotology-superbuild](https://github.com/robotology/robotology-superbuild), it is possible to use `<directory-where-you-downloaded-robotology-superbuild>/build/install` as the `<installation_path>`.

## Usage

### How to use a RealSense D435

#### As `yarpmanager` application
You can write a yarp application to launch the camera and see the RGB and Depth images. Here is a simple example:

```xml
<application>
    <name>simpleRealsense</name>
    <description>Description</description>
    <version>1.0</version>

    <module>
      <name>yarpdev</name>
          <parameters> --from sensors/RealSense_conf.ini </parameters>
      <node>localhost</node>
    </module>  

    <module>
      <name>yarpview</name>
      <parameters>--name /view/rgb:i</parameters>
      <node>localhost</node>
    </module>

    <module>
      <name>yarpview</name>
      <parameters>--name /view/depth:i</parameters>
      <node>localhost</node>
    </module>

    <connection>
      <from>/depthCamera/rgbImage:o</from>
      <to> /view/rgb:i</to>
      <protocol>mjpeg</protocol>
    </connection>

    <connection>
      <from>/depthCamera/depthImage:o</from>
      <to>/view/depth:i</to>
      <protocol>udp+recv.portmonitor+type.dll+file.depthimage_to_rgb</protocol>
    </connection>

</application>
```

:bulb: **NOTE:** When using the camera *locally* and, not over a network, the user can substitute the protocol used for visualizing the depth image as follows:

```xml
<protocol>unix_stream+recv.portmonitor+type.dll+file.depthimage_to_rgb</protocol>
```

:bulb: **NOTE:** When using YARP < 3.5, the final part of the `protocol` string should be changed from `+file.depthimage_to_rgb` to `+file.depthimage2`.


### From the command line

Set the `YARP_ROBOT_NAME` to either `CER01`, `CER02` or `CER03`. Then, run the command:

```bash
yarpdev --from sensors/RealSense_conf.ini
```

By setting the `YARP_ROBOT_NAME`, YARP finds the configuration file `RealSense_conf.ini` automatically.

`RealSense_conf.ini` contains the following settings:

```ini
device       rgbdSensor_nws_yarp
subdevice    realsense2
name         /depthCamera

[SETTINGS]
depthResolution (480 270)    #Other possible values (424 240) or (640 480)
rgbResolution   (424 240)	 #Other possible values (424 240) or (640 480)
framerate       30
enableEmitter   true
needAlignment   true
alignmentFrame  RGB

[HW_DESCRIPTION]
clipPlanes (0.2 10.0)
```

:warning: **WARNING:** the user might have to change the parameters `depthResolution` and `rgbResolution`. These parameters change depending on the firmware version installed on the used camera.

### How to use a RealSense D405

To use this model of camera you can follow the same instructions above with the following **notable** differences:

- this camera does not have an active emitter system, hence it should be disabled as not supported;
- this camera does not have separate RGB and depth sensors - it only has a depth sensor that also provides RGB images - hence only the depth resolution should be set;
- this camera does not need active software-based alignment per construction - see [here](https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/issues/11784#issuecomment-1539851902) - hence the alignment should be disabled;
- this camera is a short-range camera, hence it is suggested to provide an adequately low lower bound for the clipping planes.

Considering the above, a possible configuration file might be the following:

```ini
device       rgbdSensor_nws_yarp
subdevice    realsense2
name         /depthCamera

[SETTINGS]
depthResolution (640 480) # <-- Same resolution as the rgbResolution
framerate       30
alignmentFrame  None      # <-- alignment set to None
                          # <-- 'enableEmitter' removed as not supported

[HW_DESCRIPTION]
clipPlanes (0.01 10.0)    # <-- lower bound for clipping planes set to 0.01 meters
```

### How to use a RealSense D435i

:construction: UNDER CONSTRUCTION :construction:

### How to use a RealSense T256

#### From the command line

The device retrieving the  RealSense T256 data is the `multipleanalogsensorserver` and it must be run as follows:

```bash
yarpdev --device multipleanalogsensorsserver --name /t256 --period 10 --subdevice realsense2Tracking
```

:bulb: **NOTE:** the user should specify the parameters `--name` and `--period` as needed.

The data from a RealSense T256 will be streamed on the port named `/t256/measures:o` following the format described in the `SensorStreamingData` class.

The type on information currently made available are:

- the Gyroscope measures,
- the Accelerometer measures, and
- the Pose (position and orientation).

## Device documentation

This device driver exposes the `yarp::dev::IRGBDSensor` and
`yarp::dev::IFrameGrabberControls` interfaces to read the images and operate on
the available settings.
See the documentation for more details about each interface.

This device is paired with its server called `rgbdSensor_nws_yarp` to stream the
images and perform remote operations.

The configuration file is subdivided into 2 major sections called `SETTINGS` and
`HW_DESCRIPTION`.

The `SETTINGS` section is meant for read/write parameters, meaning parameters
which can be get and set by the device.
A common case of setting is the image resolution in pixel.
This setting will be read by the device and it'll be applied in the startup
phase.
If the setting fails, the device will terminate the execution with a error
message.

The `HW_DESCRIPTION` section is meant for read only parameters which describe
the hardware property of the device and cannot be provided by the device through
software API.
A common case is the 'Field Of View' property, which may or may not be supported
by the physical device.
When a property is present in the `HW_DESCRIPTION` group, the YARP
`RGBDSensorClient` will report this value when asked for and setting will be
disabled.
This group can also be used to by-pass realsense2 API in case some functionality
is not correctly working with the current device.
For example the `clipPlanes` property may return incorrect values or values
using non-standard measurement unit.
In this case using the `HW_DESCRIPTION`, a user can override the value got from
OpenNI2 API with a custom value.

**Note**: Parameters inside the `HW_DESCRIPTION` are read only, so the relative
set functionality will be disabled.

**Note**: For parameters which are neither in `SETTINGS` nor in `HW_DESCRIPTION`
groups, read / write functionality is assumed but not initial setting will be
performed. Device will start with manufacturer default values.

**Warning**: A single parameter cannot be present into both `SETTINGS` and
`HW_DESCRIPTION` groups.

**Warning** whenever more then one value is required by the setting, the values
must be in parentheses!
